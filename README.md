The server will be available at http://localhost:8000/.


## Accessing the API Documentation

1.  **Log in to Django Admin**:  
    Visit  `http://localhost:8000/admin/`  and log in using your superuser credentials.
    
2.  **View API Documentation**:  
    After logging in, go to  `http://localhost:8000/api/swagger/`  to access the API documentation.


## Notes from the Developer

1.  **Learning AI/ML Skills**:  
    While I didnâ€™t have prior experience with AI/ML, I dedicated time to learn and implement a recommendation system for this project. I watched numerous videos and tutorials to understand the concepts, and despite the challenges, I successfully completed the project within the deadline.
    
2.  **Data Collection**:  
    Since no datasets or APIs were provided, I web-scraped data from the Swiggy website using JavaScript in the browser console. This allowed me to gather the necessary data for the project.
    
3.  **Database Credentials**:  
    For the purpose of this assessment, I hardcoded the database credentials in the configuration. However, in real-world projects, I would use  `.env`  files to securely store sensitive information like credentials.
